# AssemblyLine
This project simulates a assembly line in a factory in VR by Meta Quest 3. Because the conveyors, robot arms and sensors are essential elements in product lines of modern factory, therefore we deploy a conveyor, a sensor and a robot arm in this virtual factory to simulate their physics, such as rolling belt to transfer products, rotating Robot arm to lift products.

In this scenario, user plays a role as a product quality inspector who is working at a assembly line. The user can use bare hand to pick up the virtual product(wooden box) on the conveyor to check the product in the virtual factory world, if the product quality is good, then put it back on the belt, otherwise ditches it, and assembly line has a item detector to count the number of products with good quality, after that robot arm will pick the product from the end of another conveyor for packing.
